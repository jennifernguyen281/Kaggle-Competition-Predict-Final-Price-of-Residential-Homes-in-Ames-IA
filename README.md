Data Mining Project - Regression Techniques using R

We want to predict house sale prices in Ames,IA using 80 housing features and identify features that have the most influence on house sale price. The best model could be used by realtors and buyers to estimate price for a house with specific features that they want to sell/buy.

We applied 11 algorithms from linear techniques such as Lasso to non-linear such as Regression Tree, from parametric techniques such as Best subset selection to non-parametric such as KNN.we conclude that the best regression model is the Gradient Boosting model with a test MSE of 0.0173.
The Gradient Boosting model reveals the top 4 most important predictors. They are OverallQual (Overall material and finish quality), GrLivArea (Above grade (ground) living area square feet), TotalBsmtSF (Total square feet of basement area), and YearBuilt (Original construction date).

Models: Best subset selection, LASSO, Ridge Regression, PCR, PLS, KNN, Regression Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting
